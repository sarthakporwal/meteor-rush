- **Control the Rocket:** Use your hands in front of your webcam. The game detects the tilt between your left and right hands to move the rocket left or right.
- **Objective:** Survive as long as possible by dodging meteors. The longer you last, the higher your distance score.
- **Lives:** You start with 4 lives. Colliding with a meteor costs a life. The game ends when all lives are lost.
- **Visual Feedback:** The game overlays your lives, distance, and game state (paused, game over) on the screen.

## How to Play

3. **Tilt to Steer:** Tilt your hands to steer the rocket left or right. Try to avoid the falling meteors!
4. **Survive:** The game tracks your distance and remaining lives. Try to beat your high score!
